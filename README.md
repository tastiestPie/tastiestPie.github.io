# tastiestPie.github.io - Gabriel Que's Personal Website

#Overview

Hi There! This is my personal website which showcases the some of the work I've done.

#Technologies Used

The website is primarily made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've also use some jQuery and Bootstrap
for some parts for the website to make it more mobile friendly. Also because it looks nice. :)

For my coding IDE, I used Atom and the Atom HTML Preview Plug-in by harmsk. I've had previous experience with
Atom, and the preview plug-in was super helpful with making and debugging the website.

#Challenges Faced

One of the challenges in making this website is learning the ins and outs of Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. This was
the first time I've used these tools in my website design, so learning them was fun, interesting, and proved to be a bit of a
challenge when it came to implementation and bug fixing.

[Challenges TBD]

#Future Features

[TBD once version 1.0 of website is up and running]
