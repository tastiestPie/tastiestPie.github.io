# tastiestPie.github.io - Gabriel Que's Personal Website (WIP)

== This website was from when I started experimenting in web dev back in 2022. Not really in use now and hasn't been updated in years, but I'm keeping it around for posterity.  ==

## Overview

Hi There! This is my personal website which showcases the some of the work I've done.

## Technologies Used

The website is primarily made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've also use some jQuery and Bootstrap
for some parts for the website to make it more mobile friendly. Also because it looks nice. :)

For my coding IDE, I used Atom and the Atom HTML Preview Plug-in by harmsk. I've had previous experience with
Atom, and the preview plug-in was super helpful with making and debugging the website. I also dabbled in some
CodePen for some prototyping.

## Project Goals

One of the main goals I had when I set out on making this project is to have a place where I can display my portfolio for anyone to see. There is where the idea of creating a portfolio website came into existence and it's something I kept in mind when designing the website.

Some other goals I had when I made this website was to experiment with and improve my Javascript skills, as well as learn Boostrap, jQuery, and other tools that help mobile responsiveness and user-interactive design.

## Challenges Faced

One of the challenges in making this website is learning the ins and outs of Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. This was
the first time I've used these tools in my website design, so learning them was fun, interesting, and proved to be a bit of a
challenge when it came to implementation and bug fixing.

[Challenges TBD]
